He was almost hit by oncoming traffic so I had to stop and pick him up.  He's definitely an older chihuahua mix but thankfully, neutered.  He needs a little TLC but overall, he is very sweet.  He really doesn't pay any mind to my dogs.  He is crate trained but I have yet to determine if he is completely housebroken.  He just wants attention and will occasionally cry in the kennel when I have to leave for work.  He walks well on lead but I don't think he knows any commands.

Her sweet little eyes are a pretty brown, and she has an adorable prance when she is out on a walk. Lilli adjusts quickly to new environments despite sometimes being shy initially. She quickly learned the doggie door at multiple houses, and can be left in her crate overnight, though she would happily sleep with her new forever mom/dad/family. She can be apprehensive around some people, but if they let her be initially, she'll come around quickly.

He lives him a home with other dogs and gets along well with everyone, but we hope that in a forever home, Turner could be one of two/three dogs or possibly an only dog to receive the devotion he deserves. He was surrendered to the shelter by a family, and while he was around children in that home, it's clear that they actually spook him.  In loud environments, you can tell that he is scared, but we've noticed tremendous improvement recently in his comfort level with new people and environments.  He walks well on leash when he knows and trusts you, but he can also lay down and freeze if frightened.  An ideal home for Turner would be one with no young kids and a calmer environment.  If someone where to continue to show him the positive sides to walks, public settings and just plain love from people - there's no doubt this guy will continue to flourish!

            "pet_bio": "Age: 5 yearsWeight: 7 lbs Well hello world - here's Nico!  This spunky little gal is looking for a family to call her own, and she's ready to give you all the love she has.  There are two sides to Nico:  the calm snuggly girl and then the active playful girl.  She loves all people although she will initially bark at new people.  She's fostered in a home with other dogs and gets along very well with all of them.  She's also got 3 2-legged kids under the age of , and she gets along fabulously with them as well.  She has seriously never met a stranger.In the evenings, Nico likes to sit in your lap, on your shoulders, under the covers in your bed.  Basically, wherever you are, she would like to be...or she'd like to be perched on the back of the couch to see where you may be from a distance.  She is crate-trained, and she's almost fully potty-trained.  She needs a little reminder when taken outside to do her business, but she's been doing fairly well.  She walks well on leash, so she may actually be used to a former apartment/condo lifestyle.For the side of Nico that is active, she would do well with a home that can offer her some physical activity and possibly some additional training.  She is highly treat/food motivated, which bodes well for increasing her bag of tricks.  Her foster family thinks she'd actually make a great agility dog for a number of reasons including her ability to climb the ladder to the kids' playscape to join them in the 'house'.  She has tried to dig under a gate at her foster home twice now, so a home without a doggie door is an absolute must as she may be a flight risk.  Upon her first escape, she ran across the street and jumped into the driver seat of her neighbor who was leaving for work.  The neighbor was quite impressed with what a lover she is, but no one is impressed with her jail break antics :).Adoption fee is $200.If you are interested in adopting, please read our Frequently Asked Questions before completing the adoption application.The application and general information can also be found at: www.smallchancerescue.com.",

            "pet_bio": "Age:  5Weight:  4.5 lbs Cody is a sweet guy who needs a very special home.  While we haven't been able to put all the pieces together on his puzzle prior to coming into our group from the shelter, we do know that he was shuffled around quite a bit over the years.  He is very timid in nature, so if you're looking for a dog that will throw himself into your arms and greet you with lots of tail wags and kisses, he's not the guy for you.  Any affection from Cody must be earned, and an adopter will have to be up for the challenge and the time involved in doing so.  Having been with his foster family now for a couple months, he is still reserved and prefers only to cuddle up at bedtime. Cody will lay down on the floor about 10 feet from the couch if his foster mom is sitting down and cry for her, but when his foster mom goes to pick him up, he darts off :).  He will follow her anywhere in the house to be where she is, but he's not interested in having her pick him up.  If she does manage to catch him, he will sit nicely on the couch, sometimes in her lap or sometimes on the far end.  At night-time, however, he will always go into his foster parents' bedroom and will finally stand still to allow you to pick him up to put him on the bed.  Unlike any chihuahua that his foster mom has ever had or fostered, he does not burrow under blankets!  At night, he will sleep on the bed, and sometimes he'll get close enough to let his foster mom rest her hand on him.  However, if you move in bed, he will scurry away again.  He seems to view the bedroom as a safe spot and enjoys lounging on the bed while his family (2-legged parents and their 2-legged kids) get ready for work/school in the morning.  He gets along well with the other dogs in his foster home although high energy dogs tend to scare him.  Based on what we do know about his history, we do think he will likely always be a timid little man, so while a lot of work with him will likely gain a loyal and happy guy...he will likely never be an outgoing, social guy.Cody's teeth were severely neglected, but he received a dental where they removed 11 teeth.  While under, we also had an x-ray done on his upper body area as he shows some discomfort/pain in the right shoulder area since arriving at his foster home.  X-rays did not show anything abnormal, however.  Cody was displaying shrieking episodes, and after witnessing an episode, the vet now believes he has been having focal seizures.  The cause of the seizures is unknown, but based on his age, she believes it's likely a mild form of epilepsy.  Cody is on a compounded prescription and has been since the middle of April, which is working!  However, a potential adopter should note that these medications cost approximately $50/month ($600 annually), and he may be on them throughout the remainder of his life.Adoption fee is $200.If you are interested in adopting, please read our Frequently Asked Questions before completing the adoption application.The application and general information can also be found at: www.smallchancerescue.com.",

He becomes very anxious around them and can snap when overwhelmed, though he has never caused harm to anyone because many of his teeth were extracted.  He is also intimidated easily and will urinate submissively.  He needs to find a home with someone who is patient and loving and willing to work with him to build his confidence and minimize this submissive behavior.  Homes with children aren't recommended because he may feel overwhelmed.  The right person will get a loving and attentive fuzzy companion in him.Adoption fee is $200.If you are interested in adopting, please read our Frequently Asked Questions before completing the adoption application.The application and general information can also be found at: www.smallchancerescue.com.",

She is a 7 year old Siberian Husky mix who is eagerly awaiting a new home with a caring and compassionate family. Kodiak would do best in a home with adults and older kids. She isnt a fan of felines and is interested in meeting your canine companion prior to being adopted. Kodiak has pretty brown eyes, a lovable face, and a mostly white fluffy coat that many love to run their fingers through. This intelligent gal knows: sit, down, watch me, and leave it. Were sure with some practice, Kodiak will master many more commands! She loves her walks and is still learning how to do well on a leash; however, she is very smart and wants to make her people happy. Kodiak also loves chasing the ball!

Marlow is calm, a good leash walker, and takes treats gently. While on his short daily walks he might experience some discomfort due to his arthritis and would love to snuggle on a comfy bed/couch, after returning. Marlow takes yummy vitamins and will need to continue to do so in his new home. Unfortunately, his eyesight isnt as well as it once was, but once he gets used to his new home, he should do very well with his new surroundings. Marlow would do best in a home with older kids and adults and he is all in for a long head and neck rub  hes even likely to gently lay his head into your hands for this amazing experience! He is a large dog, 64 pounds, with long elegant legs, a short smooth black coat, and white eyebrows that give him a distinguished wise look. This 10 year old is Heartworm Positive, therefore, he cannot be too active but luckily he has a special Guardian Angel in his life that wants to make sure he finds a loving forever home.

This 7 year old Terrier mix is ready to find his forever home with an amazing family that he can spoil. When you come to meet him, you will quickly notice what a happy boy Presley is, he never stops wagging his tail! He will be very eager to join you on daily walks and even though he gets pretty eager to explore at first, he will calm down and does pretty well on a leash. Presley is intelligent and already knows how to sit, speak, and responds to the watch me command from his people. One way to practice these skills with him is to offer him yummy treats. To show his excitement and appreciation for the treats, Presley might ask for it with a little bark and paw reach. While he is heartworm positive, after a few more treatments he will be heartworm free. If you want a boy who is full of love, happiness, and energy all rolled into a little package, Presley is the one for you. Stop by the SAHS today!

            "pet_bio": "Annabelle is a 5 yo, female, spayed, tri (ultra-soft black, purest white ruff and red-gold) pending registration Old Time Scotch Collie (OTSC). The OTSC is the predecessor of today's collie breeds that became obsolete with the disappearance of the American family farm. These collies were more stocky, and hardy than today's collie, bred for independent thinking and the stamina to herd, hunt, and protect the family farm. There are only a few hundred of these dogs left, see http://www.scotchcollie.org/). So how did Annabelle wind up in Texas Collie Rescue (TCR)?The OTSCs that have been discovered in the U.S. have come from old family ranches and farms. And Annabelle is the right age to have been turned in the San Antonio Humane Society as a pup at about the time when the Texas drought forced many San Antonio area farmers and ranchers to sell land and livestock, and part with the dogs they used to work farms and ranches that had been in operation for hundreds of years. But Annabelle can't remember living on a farm, or being taken to a shelter, or adopted. Or her owner mistaking her for an Australian Shepherd because of her coloring and docking her tail? Or getting lost? Or being stolen? That was just too long ago. And the poor dog could not say how she wound up in the back yard of a house in San Antonio in a high crime neighborhood, where someone put down an endless supply of cheap dog food that led to her becoming overweight. A high of just shy of 90 doggy pounds!It seems that Annabelle CAN remember being made to fight with other dogs, that caused the scars on her face and tongue. She is still collie-friendly and wags her stub of a tail lovingly at every dog she meets. She even wags at cats, who don't seem to want to share the love. But because of her fighting experiences, she will fight, and not back away if she is attacked by an aggressive dog.Annabelle must be with a family with a gentle dog friend, or no other dog at all. She should not visit a dog park where aggressive dogs might attack her. And she should not live in a home with very young children who might startle her by poking a stick in her eye when mom or dad aren't looking. And yes your little darling will do it even if you don't think she/he will, because young kids just don't know any better! And Annabelle also seems to remember being left alone in a yard until there was no more food to eat, and finally breaking down a gate to try to find water and food. She wandered for days through a neighborhood that you and I would be afraid to hang out in after dark before she was caught by a Good Samaritan Rescuer, who called Texas Collie Rescue. So now Annabelle keeps a close (almost-human-in-intelligence-and-perception) eye on, and stays where she can always see her Foster Mom to be sure she is never abandoned again. And she will be a loyal and devoted friend to/protector of her new owner(s) forever.Annabelle just had her teeth cleaned and one broken tooth extracted. So she has a bright new Pepsodent smile, gentle brown eyes, and gorgeous soft coat. Other than being overweight, she is completely healthy (HW negative).Annabelle is outrageously smart, and could learn anything a dog can be trained to do, as you are inclined (obedience, herding), or just be a beautifully mannered best friend and protector. She can sit, shake, lie down and loves to go on loose leash walks (you could build endurance and work off those pounds together!).She is ready to love her new person/family forever. Annabelle is a special collie in many ways, and you will know after seeing her pictures and reading her story that she is YOUR dog. To adopt her, contact Linda  at http://www.texascollierescue.org/",

My fur was so matted they had to shave me.  The shelter thought I was a boy and they were calling me King, turns out I was a girl under all that hair.  Things are so much better for me now and I am ready to go to my forever home.  How about you?  My fur has grown out and is in full blown collie glory!  I'm great on the leash and like going for walks.  I'm house-trained and crate-trained too.  When I'm tired I put myself to bed.  I do enjoy my bed since I didn't have one for the longest time.!  I think you need a sweet collie girl like me to give you lots of love and attention.  There's an application at www.texascollierescue.org that you need to fill out so you can meet me.  I can't wait to meet you!SkylarSkylar is as sweet as can be.  The shape she was in was unspeakable when she came to us.  There is a before picture of her which doesn't even begin to show the bad shape she was really in.  The groomer said it was the worst case they had ever seen.  She was shaved down and now has her full coat back. She is a beautiful girl.   All she wants is to be loved and to be near someone.  Her eyes are beautiful and very expressive. We think she is about 6 years old.  Over time she has become arthritic due to prior injuries..  We do give her supplements for this. She is a low-key, quiet dog.  She would do best in a family with no children. We would love for you to open your heart and your home to her.",

We really enjoy a good car ride. Charlie, my brother is a laid back kind of guy and me, I'm  more outgoing and nosey, but I prefer curious.  We get along with other dogs, kids, and even like cats.  Now here's the thing.  Our forever home needs to be the same one.  So if you are looking for two great family pups look no further.  And then you can say you are part of the royal family!!  Before you can meet us you need to go to www.texascollierescue.org and fill out an application. Check us out.  My picture is the first one and Charlie is the second one.  The third one is Charlie being laid back.Lady and CharlieWhen Lady and Charlie came to us they were in pretty sad shape.  They were an owner surrender from Dennison, Texas.  Their coats were so badly matted they had to be shaved.  When they  grow out they will be beautiful dogs.  Their foster mom says they are both very sweet and are cuddlers.  So if you are looking for some cuddle bugs we have them.  Lady has the tendency to jump on people and would probably not do well with small children.  However, they do need to go to their forever home together.  They are bonded and we don't split them up when they are. Let us hear from you if you are interested.

But, since the rescue was told Arnie was a collie mix and I was his friend they took us both in.  Way lucky for me!  I have a warm bed and some good food now.  I'm a young one they say since my teeth are pretty and white.  I'll be honest I'm going to be a work in progress since I haven't learned all my doggie manners.

He has all the markings, the coloring, and facial features right down to the bushy tail they have. So this boy is an Australian Cattle Dog.  Best guess on his age is about a year and a half to two. He's friendly and loves to play.  As he said he hasn't learned all his doggie manners. But, he's a smart boy and will be a fast learner.  If you want to meet Jake go to our website and fill out an application.",

Purr was surrendered because her owner's husband died and she lost her job and house. Purr was very scared at the SPCA. She quickly settled in at Kitty Charm School and over time warmed to her new human family. We think she'd be a great fit in a quiet home, probably happiest without small children or other cats. She'd love someone willing to give her a chance to fall in love with him or her. Loves chin scratches and full body pets. Has a goofy playful side when she doesn't think you are looking.

I love to be around you, I love affection and I love to cuddle! I especially love kisses on my head! Would you like a bundle of LOVE in your life? Then you'll want to meet me and we can be forever friends! I get along very well with my foster mom's animal kids, cat and dogs included! I prefer a quiet home, maybe even with a mellow cat friend. I get along ok with dogs but would rather cuddle with my human and cat friends, or maybe a smaller calm dog. I've been through a lot after my family of 9 years didn't want to keep me anymore since the new kitty bullied me. I was a little scared and shy at first. But thankfully, Give Me Shelter saved me, found me a loving and patient foster family and gave me another chance to find a new furever home. I can't wait to be your loyal Leila and love you bunches!Please note:- Leila is a Special Needs catFor more information or to apply for Leila, please go to:http://www.givemesheltersf.org/adoption/cat.php?id=10123[id=10123;ts=1437498120;0000000000]",

            "pet_bio": "Video of Ginger: http://animoto.com/play/2WgJBnDMwjlHBPPSwNGJ1QWe saw Ginger right before Christmas 2010. She was a stray and had puppies under a raised house. The shelter was contacted.  They caught Ginger and her puppies. We took Ginger and the puppies into our rescue. Ginger was so bad off we thought she would die and the puppies would live. Ginger had bad heartworms and so many intestinal parasites that food was backing up in her stomach. She was super skinny but any when she ate her stomach got huge. Unfortunately, we were unable to save her puppies, as they had herpes did not survive. Ginger was treated and is now heartworm negative. Ginger loves attention. Her favorite activity is to have her belly rubbed. She just flips right over and shows her belly. She loves to cuddle and give kisses. She doesn't even move when I clip her nails. Ginger is afraid of most dogs. She can be walked in the park around other dogs and has no issue becaue she's only focused on you. Ginger has been loose in the yard with different dogs over the years. If they are not on a leash you can see her eyes get big and she's afraid. She's never hurt one. Once Ginger and another dog got out of their crates at a foster home. Ginger got the worst end of the deal. The other dog had barely a scratch. She kisses the other dogs through the kennels. She's approximately 6 years old and 30 lbs. She is a tiny light brown brindle pit bull. Ginger is up to date on shots, flea prevention and heartworm prevention. She had a negative fecal. She had a good vet exam. She's also microchipped. We've had Ginger 3.5 years now. She stays in a crate because the foster has other dogs. Ginger is no longer happy and she's crying. Ginger recently got HGE, a disease caused by stress. We were able to fix her condition but we know Ginger is no longer happy and needs a new forever home asap. She is miserable and we desperately want her to have the loving home she deserves. Ginger has had a hard life and she deserves better. She needs a home without any other animals. Ginger would be good with an active person or a couch potato. She loves children. Ginger's fee is $100.  If you are interested in Ginger, please email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com",

She was covered in ticks, fleas, and lice. She also had demodex mange. She went through heartworm treatment and was spayed. Honey is very shy around new places as she was feral. She's learning to be a dog. She snuggles with her foster mom. She plays with the other dogs and with toys. She goes outside. She hates a crate though. She has come a long way, and is improving daily.

We think he would be perfect for a child. He's very relaxed. His fee is $76.  If you are interested in Kermit email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com",

            "pet_bio": "Thelma is a 5 year old adorable mutt. According to Yappy Happy's petfinder she was born at JoyceCharles' house on November 7, 2009. She is very timid as a result of living in that environment. She didn't get the proper socialization she needed in her early years. She will never be a normal dog but is making progress. She will now let me pick up her. She walks around the house wagging her tail and it's always upright. She will walk around if the new people in the house are sitting on the couch. If they are standing up or go near her she barks. We're working on this. She's spayed and heartworm negative. She's up to date on shots, flea and heartworm prevention. We have no idea on her breed, just super cute. She barks at the cats if door is closed but doesn't do anything if she's loose around the kittens. I think she's just watched and learned by the others acting up.  Thelma's mother is a chihuahua.  Because Thelma came from a hoarding situation, she is not yet housebroken but we are working on that.  If you are interested in Thelma, please email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com.",

            "pet_bio": "Daphy was hit by a car a few weeks ago. She luckily didn't have any breaks. She's full of life & looking for her second chance at a wonderful full life. Daphy is young maybe 1 1/2 years & just a mutt. She's currently 55 lbs but skinny. Guess she'll be 60 lbs. She's a little timid at first but doesn't take long to warm up and be your best friend. She'd love a foster to introduce her to a lot of people and places to show her life will no longer be cruel. It won't take long to change her outlook on life. This will greatly increase her chances of adoption as large mutts are our hardest to adopt. I think she would be a great running partner. Maybe a volunteer would want to test drive her (I can't run)? She loves to run in the backyard and play fetch. Someone has taught her manners. She jumps around me excitedly but never touches me. She walks great on a leash but does pull so that needs corrected. She's a perfect passenger in the car. I personally think she should only be crated for a few years. She's scared at being left again plus she's young. She's only barked in the crate when she needs to potty. She only wants outside to potty and come immediately inside unless someone is with her. She's dog and cat friendly. She's heartworm negative. She's up to date on shots, flea and heartworm prevention. She had xrays and exams to ensure she's healthy. She had a negative fecal. She's got a few more weeks before she can be spayed as she came to us in heat. Please email us at animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com if you'd like to foster, adopt, socialize or take her for a run. She's going to make someone an excellent pet. She's currently in New Orleans, LA.",

            "pet_bio": "Joy the poodle is looking for her forever home! She is such a sweet, smart girl & very loving! She plays with the other dogs in her foster home, is a huge cuddle bug & likes to give kisses & be held. She loves doing dog puzzles or learning new things, as she is extremely smart!  Joy is very athletic & can jump high as well as climb. She would be awesome with someone who wants to do agility, although that's not a necessity because she is just as happy laying in your lap.  The down side to this is that she can easily jump over a baby gate with no problem.  A double baby gate (so two high in the doorway) will stop her or she also does not mind going in her kennel.  Joy never tries to escape, she just always wants to be by her humans.  She loves to follow her foster mom around the house or yard, lay in her lap or be held. She will flourish in a home that enjoys training, will keep her mentally stimulated & loves to cuddle! Joy has some social anxiety issues that we have been working on.  When new people come into her house, she is not always friendly.  She has never been known to bite, however, will growl or jump up.  Joy also likes to guard her owners in bed at night so if one gets up & comes back, she may guard the one still laying down.  As long as Joy is put up when strangers come into the home & sleeps in her kennel at night, you'll never have a better pet!  Once she warms up to someone, though, she is extremely loving.  Joy does well on a leash & in a kennel.  She is housebroken & will even go out in the rain to hurry up & potty & come back.  She's spayed and microchipped. She's heartworm negative and had a negative fecal. She's up to date on shots, Comfortis and heartworm prevention. Contact Animal Helper Rescue Group (animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com) for adoption information.  Her adoption fee is $150",

(Nothing negative just a fact as they have very limited resources & we're always thankful they ask for help). His rear leg had been de-gloved & broken. We amputated his leg at 5 weeks. Nothing slows this sweet boy down! He loves to play and cuddle. He's doing well with potty training and kennel training. He loves other dogs and dog friendly cats. He's roughly 10 weeks old and weighs a little over 12 pounds. He is probably a pit bull mix. Please contact animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com if you are interested in adopting this wonderful boy!",

She doesn't chew on these, just takes them back to her bed.Mama D does very well with other dogs although she will let them know to keep their space. She does not bark often. Ma D did well enough with the one car ride we took; she stood in the back and looked out.Mama D is a gentle giant.

The property will be demolished in the next few weeks. Sergio cannot be there during this time & has no where to go. Remember black dogs are very hard to place. Mutts are harder to place. Bigger mutts are harder to place. We also have a harder time placing males. All these combined makes his chances slim. Sergio is 40 lbs & ~4 years old. He's neutered. Sergio is heartworm positive but will be on medicine to prepare him for heartworm treatement. Sergio is up to date on shots, heartworm & flea prevention. He had a great exam.
