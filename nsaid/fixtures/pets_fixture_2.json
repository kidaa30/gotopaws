            "pet_bio": "Content, Quiet, Special Winnie is a mellow and happy girl. She likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka Cat TV), to chase the laser light, and to battle string toys. She plays with other cats but prefers privacy when she takes a nap. And if you have a vacant lap, she will take up residence in it and purr! Winnie was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes her to be incontinent. This means she needs a compassionate owner who will help her express her urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Winnie doesn't have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping her clean - she is so accommodating! Winnie has beautiful green eyes and a sweet demeanor. She must always remain an indoor cat, but she does like to bask outside in a protected, enclosed area, such as a chicken coop or a rabbit hutch (without the chickens or rabbits, of course!). If you are looking to adopt a wonderful cat who also has special needs, we think you should meet Winnie. She will completely love you back. Contact us to meet her today! All APA! foster kittens/cats are tested for FeLV/FIV, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, treated for worms/fleas, microchipped and come with a 30-day health insurance plan. If you have additional questions about Winnie, please send an email to adopt@austinpetsalive.org.",

            "pet_bio": "We call him Chuck the Explorer. He has an odd and clumsy sort of gait, but that doesn't stop him from doing what he was born to do: sniffing. He's a natural investigative reporter, a newshound, a dashing detective. He makes even the occasional stumble look graceful and intentional, as if it is just part of his technique. Chuck likes to sniff out and thoroughly investigate any lead, scent, or visiting dog he encounters while on his walks. You are invited to come along. Every good reporter needs a trusty sidekick. After that walk, and perhaps some play (yes, Chuck does like to play, with his sidekick and with other dogs), Chuck is ready to settle in for some serious petting. He may be smart and independent, but he is also a sweet, affectionate kind of a guy. Chuck was adopted two years ago, but his family had to return him to APA! after they had to move overseas. They reported only positive notes - he is still the same sweet, adventurous and slightly clumsy dog he was when he was first with us. As much as he loves to explore, what Chuck really wants is a forever home. Exploring is no fun without a place to come back to.We think he'd do best in most homes, but he would especially love a yard and the occasional long and leisurely walk. He's a quick study, and had been working on some agility training when we saw him last. We're sure he'd love to get back into it. As happy as we are to see Chuck again, we'd be happiest to see him leave with the loyal, loving family he deserves. Can you join him on his biggest adventure yet?All APA adoptions come with free behavior assistance through APA's behavior team. And remember, when you adopt a dog from APA, you are saving not one, but two lives - the life of the dog you're bringing into your home, and the next dog APA can save in the adopted dog's place.",

She has been working hard to become the perfect companion, and has already come a long way in her training. She is whip-smart and eager for more challenges!This gorgeous girl was on the euthanasia list at the city shelter because she wasn't very interested in people. She just wanted to get out and explore the world. In just a few months since being rescued by APA!, though, she's become friendlier and friendlier, and will now happily rub up against your legs and ask for a nice belly rub after a rousing game of toy swapping.Vickie already knows the 'sit' command, and while it is not known if she is house trained, it is safe to say she'll learn quickly. She's a high energy dog and, with a little more leash training, will be a great running partner. Lifetime behavior training assistance is included with adoption. She prefers to watch her girlish figure, so she's not very treat motivated, but she absolutely loves toys and will flash a beautiful grin at you to melt your heart and convince you to pamper her with more. She needs to be the only pet in an adult-only home.Vickie is a stunning, blossoming sweet girl, and would love to be the one-and-only dog in your life.

Even though Rusty Sledge is almost completely deaf, he is an amazingly smart guy who has been trained with hand signals for commands such as Sit, Down, Watch Me, Stay, and Stop. Get this: Rusty Sledge can even run on a treadmill. There's no telling how many more tricks this smarty can learn, especially considering how food motivated he is. Rusty Sledge is an energetic entertainer who will be a perfect running companion or just a bouncy playmate. Inside that muscular body, though, is a softie who will glance at you with his gentle eyes to see when you're ready for his company. Rusty Sledge is fully housetrained, although he still needs a little work to dial down his energy a notch or two. He needs to be the only pet in an adult home. He will thrive with owners who will give him plenty of exercise, interaction and playtime. Adoption includes free behavior support through APA.Rusty Sledge will be such a treat for some lucky family.

            "pet_bio": "Love is Unconditional.   Being different doesn't matter to her, being loved does. Caring for a special needs pet may take less time or money than you think... and the life you'll save is priceless.   O'Purry has a condition that is called Manx Syndrome. This means she was born without a tail and a shorter spine than most cats which has caused her to be fecally incontinent, and she also needs her bladder expressed a couple of times a day -- we know that sounds scary, but don't worry! Her foster and our vets will walk you through how to care for O'Purry and her special needs. O'Purry is easy to express and has no problems as long as you express her regularly (morning, lunch, after work and before bed). She will probably have to wear a diaper her entire life, but she doesn't let that stop her. She is a brave kitty, takes all of this all in stride, and still plays like a happy, confident kitten!   O'Purry, because of her shortened spine, also walks a bit differently than other cats. She gets around just fine, and is cute as a button! She moves more like a rabbit than a cat and can be heard hopping around from downstairs. She is able to climb up a cat tree but has to work hard to jump up on a chair. She loves to play with balls and mice and likes other cats. She will seek out your lap to sit and purr on.   Please email us to find out more about O'Purry an set up a meet and greet today!   All APA! foster kittens/cats are tested for FeLV/FIV, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, treated for worms/fleas, microchipped and come with a 30-day health insurance plan.

            "pet_bio": "UPDATE 4/19/15.  This beautiful, loving girl is still searching for a permanent home.  We believe Diva is now about 7 years of age.  Diva's wish list is for a mature single female.  Someone who only wants love and devotion from their dog companion.  Diva has too many fears for a lot of walks and will be happiest and most secure just living with her guardian in her home with hopefully a lovely yard to sit in the sun and watch the squirrels and birds.  Diva's foster mom really loves Diva.  But she cannot give her the undivided attention and devotion the Diva craves.  Please email us for more information on Diva.Diva's is one of those heart-wrenching, soul crushing stories from which many turn away.  She was thrown out on a highway (seen by others) with her brother at perhaps 8-10 weeks of age.  Her brother was killed immediately and after she grieved, she found a culvert for shelter.  There she lived for months and survived by the kindness of a few who would stop to throw dry food out to her.  On the way back to Dallas from a home visit in Missouri, I stopped for gasoline at a small station in east Texas and saw her there.  I offered a reward to anyone who could catch her without harming her and shortly thereafter we had our Diva.  Diva got along so well with the other dogs and was so grateful for a never-ending bowl of food, fresh water and kindness.  She was always timid with people and we were very selective when searching for a home for her.  We thought we found the perfect match in a couple that professed commitment and love for her.  It took us several months to finalize the adoption because we wanted to be sure this was the right home.  Almost five years later Diva was returned to us -- almost unrecognizable (as you can see from the pictures), terribly overweight, and terrified.  We are blessed to have an extremely experienced, knowledgeable and caring trainer and close friend offer to foster Diva.  While progress has been made, we feel Diva needs to be posted as a Special Needs dog.  Below is what we feel will be the perfect home for this loving and sweet soul.DIVA must have either a FEMALE ONLY home or a couple where the man has infinite patience and dedication -- and as the only pet.  We can never know what really happened in her previous home.  She is leery of other dogs (but is fostered in a home with other dogs and gets along with them.)  While it is asking a lot,  I KNOW there is someone who wants unconditional love with a companion that asks almost nothing.  There IS a kind, patient, understanding and loving person that will appreciate and nurture this special girl.  Diva will never be a \"dog park\" dog.  She wants to feel safe and secure in her own home with a window to look outside.  Not too much to ask.  Diva loves tummy rubs and to lie beside you. PLEASE FORWARD DIVA'S INFORMATION SO THAT HER FOREVER HOME CAN BE FOUND.  If any dog deserved comfort and love, it is Diva.  Email Gail at can.adoptions@yahoo.com.",

Bruno is in training classes at the Canine Center for Training and Behavior.  We believe Bruno would be happiest as an only dog with a single man who is looking for a forever companion.  Bruno seems to favor men and needs someone who is a \"quiet alpha\" who will provide the self confidence and commitment. Bruno's trainer has said Bruno is a \"soft\" dog and believes he has a lot of potential, as do I.  We would love to talk more with you about this wonderful boy.  Please email me at can.adoptions@yahoo.com.UPDATE 1/13/15:  WOW -- this dog is fantastic!  Very obedient and wants to please.  We have learned that Bruno had very little socialization in his life, and the other dogs in his original home jumped him from time to time.  We are working with him on meeting new dogs to show him that not every dog wants to start a fight.  He is in a large kennel with a senior dog and he has already settled down.  BRUNO LOVES TO RUN!!  He will make a fantastic running partner for someone.  And with his size should keep his guardian safe.  He is probably a little too big and active for smaller children.  He doesn't know his own strength and is dying to play with someone.  This boy is SWEET as they come and only needs someone committed to working with him.AWESOME DOG!!!  I am Bruno's foster mom.  I have only had him one day and am already in LOVE with this young man.  Bruno is about 2 years of age, 75 pounds, and a lump of love.  Through no fault of his own he has spent most of his life sitting in a backyard alone.  We are working on \"manners\" and he is VERY smart and obedient.  I envision a very active home for Bruno where he might be a running or jogging partner to some lucky person.  Bruno is already learning not to jump up (because he craves attention).  He went right into his kennel last night with no complaints!!  Bruno is going to be someone's best friend and confidant.",

I was previously in a home with two female dogs who I was happy to share my toys with and was very gentle with them. I am an easy natured boy who is happy being my crate. I sometimes just hang out and nap in my crate......it's a safe place for me! I also enjoy the company of kids and would be happy in a home with dogs and/or kids. I enjoy long walks and have learned to walk well on a leash.......if I get excited and pull a little too hard, a little reminder to 'settle down' gets me back on the right path!

            "pet_bio": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hi, my name is Charlie. My owners literally threw me from a car when they found out I could not hear. Being deaf is scary enough without being tossed out of a car. I didn't understand why since I am a very loving boy who is eager to please. I just need someone who can work with my hearing loss. I am very smart and could easily learn hand signals. I love playing ball and with toys. I am a young handsome boxer mix with one brown eye and one blue eye. I am also a BIG snuggle bug, but since I have been living in a kennel for the past few years I have no one to snuggle with and I am very sad. I am understandably afraid of moving cars. I don't mind riding in them, but they scare me on walks. I would prefer a home of my own or one where I can trust the other dogs around won't hurt me or take my food. Since, I communicate with my eyes, some dogs find that as a threat or challenge. I am also not fond of smaller dogs or cats. I am hoping that my days of living (if you call that living) in a kennel will soon be over. At night I dream of a warm bed, soft pats on the head, and belly rubs. Are you that special person who could make my dreams come true? If so, please consider fostering or adopting me. Please contact LSBR for more information about me or to meet me!

Just look at me now compared to a few weeks ago! Check out my pictures! Hi friends, my name is Riley and please don't let my horrible photos get you down or keep you from reading more about me. Thankfully, my story goes from awful to incredible. It is my hope that sharing my story will inspire others to treat animals better and make the world a better place. As you can see from the photos, I looked beyond pitiful when I came into rescue from the pound. I was severely emaciated and due to lack of food and poor nutrition, I lost all my hair and developed a horrible skin infection. Amazingly, I tested heartworm negative. Although I was painful to look at, good food, vitamins and medication are restoring me to what I'm supposed to be a beautiful, young pup with a joy for life. After a month in rescue, I've gained back my weight and my hair is slowly growing in. Skin takes the longest to heal according to my vet. I feel like a new dog compared to how I felt that day I was rescued. I had no hope and thought I was on my way out. What a happy day when the lady picked me up from the shelter, spoke to me kindly and carefully handled me knowing how painful my skin was. That is when I started to feel the hope. The vet thinks I'm under a year old and it looks I'll be a black dog with white markings when my hair returns. I'm also on the smaller side, weighing under 40 pounds. Until my hair returns and my skin fully heals, we can't begin to guess what my pedigree is. I am already house-trained and crate-trained. I am excellent with kids and other dogs. I love playing with toys of all kinds. I also know how to walk on leash and to sit. I'm very smart and I take care of my potty business when I'm told. Please help me write a beautiful, fairy tale ending to my rags to riches story by adopting me as a member of your family. When my hair returns, not only will you have a well-behaved, smart, loyal family member but also a really good-looking one with quite a story. Please contact Hopeful Hearts Animal Rescue at ann23hhar@gmail.com for an adoption application. July 20, 2015, 9:53 pm",

I was rescued by LSBR from BARC........that was a scary place and I'm so thankful to be out of there! I've been vetted and am now in a foster home! I'm really enjoying the 'home' life as you can tell from my pictures! I enjoy the company of dogs and would love to find a forever home with a fur sibling that's my size or bigger.......I'm not accustomed to small dogs and haven't been tested around cats but I'm thinking probably no cats in my perfect forever home. I so enjoy the company of people of all ages! Like most boxers, I'm a hugger/jumper so that may be a little much for very young kids; however, a little training will help cure me of this! I can tell you that I'm very sweet! I'm crate trained but sometimes I like to protest my crate a bit; however once I'm in my crate I'm fine! I'm house broken as well and in my foster home, I learned quickly how to use a doggy door. I'm leash trained and I know how to 'sit' and 'shake'....especially when treats are involved! If you find that you cannot resist this face or my happy disposition, please complete an application and come to meet me soon! July 20, 2015, 9:53 pm",

I found myself lost on the streets with no access to water or food in the Texas heat. Next thing you know, I couldn't go any further and just had to lie down in somebody's yard. I was suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Word of advice, Drink lots of water in this heat friends. The great news is that an angel rescued me from that yard and took me to the vet where I quickly perked up after receiving some water and food. Angels are for real!!! My angel, Kayla, is trying to help me find a wonderful family to call my own. She has named me Noelle which is a lovely name. I am a female boxer mix that is between 1-2 years of age. I am heartworm negative and I love to play with other dogs and people. I am off the charts in sweetness and cuteness. I am also crate and house-trained. I am anxious to find a home where I will be safe and loved. This isn't a one way street with me. I give back and what I have to offer is loyalty, love, kisses, and lots of smiles!!! Please consider opening your heart and home to a wonderful dog like me. You may contact my angel, Kayla at 713- 703-1528 or email her at kbcrenshaw@comcast.net. July 20, 2015, 9:53 pm",

            "pet_bio": "My name is Zeus. I am a beautiful male American Eskimo...sometimes people just call us \"Spitz\" or more lovingly, \"Eskie\".  I am about 2 years old and a perfect \"10\".  ;)  My rescuer does ask that you fill out an application before meeting me...and there is a donation request of at least $250.00 to adopt me.    I used to be in a not so nice place, they called it \"the animal control\" but I am not sure why because they never controlled me!  I was in my best behavior though as I was afraid. Then some very nice people got me out of there , cleaned me up and made me feel better . I am now in a foster home and have LOTS of foster brothers and sisters to play with.    I stand up on my back legs and wave at you , Dad says I look like a HUGE Meercat . Especially if you have treats ! I have a very special job here . I am a home alarm system . I let Dad and Mom know when someone comes to the steps . I also smile ( kinda ) . I'm just one happy guy...and I LOVE my leash. All I ask is a secure fenced in back yard. A pillow or two . I'm smart , very smart . I am a bit curious about cats, they look strange and I just don't know what to make of them.     If you would like to adopt me, please fill out the New Leash on Life! American Eskimo Dog Rescue Application on their website \" www.nlol.net\" , email newleashonlife@att.net or call Carol Raymond at 210-410-7334",

            "pet_bio": "King Pigeons make great pets and companion birds. They are sweet, smart, calm, and full of personality. But people are not very aware of them as being pets and they have a hard time finding a home. Kings are domestic pigeons that are bred to be eaten, but they sometimes escape or are set \"free\". They do not survive long on their own. The lucky ones, like Swift, end up in shelters, though they often wait for a long time before finding a home. Come in and see Swift and the other King Pigeons at the shelter and see if these are the companions you have been waiting for and just did not know it yet.

            "pet_bio": "Pickles is likely a lab-chi-terrier-dachshund mix, 5 year old, neutered male dog in good health with all shots who weighs between 16-18 pounds. His short, neat coat is golden. He is short-legged and long-bodied has stand-up ears, a ready-to-wag tail with a slight curve, and big brown eyes in an intelligent, expressive, foxy face. He is really cute.Pickles is an extremely affectionate & loving little dog with the people he loves. We believe that he is a recovering victim of abuse, so he is afraid of strangers, so all introductions must be done very carefully and patiently. He loves to cuddle, kiss and play. He is a smart little dog who learns quickly. It takes a few days for Pickles to fall in love with people, but thereafter he is super-sweet. Pickles really needs a special gentle kind affectionate person or people to love and take care of him. Because of his fear issues, he should be in an adult only household. Pickles has a medium energy level, and only needs moderate exercise. He walks very well on leash. Pickles loves to play with his toys and especially play ball. Pickles gets along very well with other dogs & likes dogs both inside and out of his pack. He prefers to sleep with his person, but can sleep elsewhere, including a crate. He is a natural watch dog, but only barks for a good reason. With some gentle love, care & training, Pickles will make a fine house or apartment dog.Please email adopt@rocketdogrescue.org or TEXT at 415-756-8188 with 'PICKLES' in the subject line for more info.Thanks you for considering adoption!Adopting a rescued animal is a lifetime commitment!

She can be very content sitting in her perch looking out the window, but she is always ready to go out with you. She's crate-trained, spayed, chipped and licensed (SF). She shows signs of being a world-class swimmer and athlete (her ability to catch pop flies is astounding). Hallie is nearly 2 years old (born in March 2012) and needs a LOT of exercise, every day. She is 60 lbs of muscle and curiosity! Once sufficiently tired out, she loves relaxing with a squeak toy or curling up near you to snooze. She is a lovely girl who is extremely wiggly and adores people!Those looking to adopt Hallie must be experienced pit handlers or exp with large strong breeds, preferably with their own outdoor or yard space.

Coleman's crate trained and house broken (as long as he has access outdoors).Shortly after the photo on the counter, he spent a month at a board and train program, where he made progress paying attention and following commands (sit, down, stand, stay, heel, come, wait), but respect-based training will always be a daily requirement since he takes a yard for every inch. He loves to play hard and cuddle soft with his female foster mate but is not socialized around cats, or small dogs. He will do great in an adult home. Coleman needs an experienced handler who enjoys a strict training regimen and who has the time and commitment for a dog who loves to push the boundaries. That said, in a firm and loving home, Coleman will be a truly rewarding companion.

Frankie, in true weiner dog style, is a chatty guy (NOT a barker), he is affectionate, charming and loves to cuddle. He LOVES the beach, rides well in the car and he LOVES his toys  he is very silly.  Frankie is attentive to corrections, knows basic commands and with continued love, and consistent household rules this boy will continue to be a wonderful loving companion. Frankie is a beautiful boy, with a white heart marking on his forehead, a sweet pink nose  and his Opossum cartoon-like looks and charm. I think he would like to live with another dog (or two) so he has company while his people are away (he really enjoys the company of his foster brothers and sister). we recommend he be placed in an adult home or one with older (10+) respectful dog savvy children.

She's not all taker tho... she does half the work by standing on her back legs and reaching up to meet your hand when you go to pet her. She also loves to give \"kisses.\"  If you are looking for a friendly people-loving cat look no further!Sookie must be adopted into a home that already has a cat. She will make a wonderful companion to your kitty. She is currently fostered with a young male kitty and does well with him. She has also lived with children in the past and gets along with everyone. Please fill out the adoption application on our website if you are interested in meeting her. Wonder Cat Rescue is not a shelter, but a team of caring foster homes and volunteers who open our own homes to needy cats until permanent placement can be found. By adopting a cat from Wonder Cat Rescue, you're making a commitment to provide love, care, and medical treatment for the life of the cat, which can be up to 20 years or more.  Adopting a cat is a serious decision, but a very rewarding one! We make every effort to make the best possible match when placing our cats/kittens with new families. Once you submit an application you will be contacted if the particular cat/kitten you are interested in is a good match for you. Many times kittens have several interested parties and you will be contacted if/when a meeting is appropriate. Each adoptive homes is screened carefully, and a lot of support is given to make sure the adoption is a success. When cats have a 'pending' banner, it means we are no longer accepting applications, and he/she will be placed in their forever home soon. Sorry we do not ship under any circumstances.

They are all ready to go on to their forever homes. She is very delicate. He body shape is very Siamese-like. She is slim and long with a regal profile. She's been a devoted Mama but is now starting to play and romp around with her little buds instead of always protectively being on Mama-alert for a cry or too much rough-housing. She's ready to go back to being a young kitty herself.She is very gentle with people. Loves soft head and face rubs. Loves to play with balls, chases them all over and carries them around in her mouth. She has been spayed and is in good health.Callie must be adopted with one of her kittens (Piccolo is esp. bonded with her Mama cause she is the littlest in the litter and Mama is esp protective of her. Search CL for sep post about little Piccolo.) Or into a home that has a kitty to play with her.

She also had awful teeth, her fur was almost all the way gone and her nail had grown so long that they curled back under and were growing in tot he pads of her feet making it painful to stand or walk. With the help of an amazing foster home (and a surgery to spay her and remove some rotten teeth), Sunny is finally ready for her new home. She is great with humans, but selective of her canine friends. She prefers calm dogs to 'in your face' or rambunctious pups. Sunny is about 4 years old, up to date on shots, spayed, housetrained and microchipped. If interested, fill out the online app at www.zeusrescues.org or. email zeusrescues@gmail.com.",

She has plenty of kisses to give, and will want to lay on your lap for some lovin' and will nudge you for more lovin' after that. She knows 'sit' and her tail is always wagging. Octavia went on a \"foster sleepover!\" Here is what her foster mom said about her: \"Octavia is great with both cats and dogs as long as she is properly introduced and the initial introduction is not rushed. She is housetrained and comfortable in the crate. She loves to go on walks and does well on the walk with a harness. She was very quiet in the house and respectful. She is a lap dog who just wants to cuddle up with you and give kisses. She seems to love men and women equally.
